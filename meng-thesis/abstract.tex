Currently, job owners do not have a good way to generate suitable Service Level Agreements (SLAs), which means that they can't communicate their priorities to Google's job scheduler. This means that the owner's job might not get done on time or at all. My solution is to help users visualize design changes to SLAs and use simulation to explore the behavior resulting from the SLAs. I have designed and begun development of a visualization and simulation framework that allows users to see how the job scheduler's behavior might vary under different SLA parameters. This thesis describes the steps made towards designing and implementing a system that both helps users visualize SLAs and their reward functions, and allows them to create an SLA and gain an idea of the behavior of a job scheduler with the SLA as input.
