This project is used to compile an MIT thesis where the mutable portions of the thesis are stored in Google docs.

To set up a local environment to build the thesis in OS X, use the
following commands:
  NOTE: requires wget (to install on OS X see
  http://code.google.com/p/rudix/downloads/detail?name=wget-1.12-0.dmg)
  1) mkdir meng-thesis && cd meng-thesis
  2) wget http://web.mit.edu/dbetser/Public/1122/build_thesis.sh
  3) chmod u+x ./build_thesis.sh
  4) ./build_thesis.sh  # This will download the Makefile, build the pdf,
                        # and open it.
