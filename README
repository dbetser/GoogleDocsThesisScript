This project is used to compile an MIT thesis where the mutable portions of the thesis are stored in Google docs.

To set up a local environment to build the thesis in OS X, use the following commands:
  NOTE: requires wget (to install on OS X see
  http://code.google.com/p/rudix/downloads/detail?name=wget-1.12-0.dmg)
  1) mkdir meng-thesis && cd meng-thesis
  2) wget http://web.mit.edu/dbetser/Public/1122/build_thesis.sh
  3) chmod u+x ./build_thesis.sh
  4) ./build_thesis.sh  # This will download the Makefile, build the pdf, and open it.

When adding a new chapter:
  1) Create a new Google doc for the chapter, and set its visibility settings to either “Anyone with the link” or “Public on the web”.
  2) Add the line \include{chapX} for the new chapter to main.tex, where X is the chapter index.
  3) Add and define the variable chapX_tex_URL to the makefile.
  4) Add the dependency for the new chapter in the main.pdf target of the makefile.
